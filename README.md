# Electrical code projects

This has my python programs that calculate service demands
The school one is complete up to the point I needed it for school
The apartment one is still in need of work 
I didnt know of a better way of passing a lot of user generated variables
the text file option was the first thing that came to mind

With that being said the .py files need to be run with the .txt,
on the command line

I thought I had was to add in all the code rule aabove their functions
